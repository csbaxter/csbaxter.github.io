# Contributing to Runestone Server

We welcome contributions large and small to the Runestone Components. We welcome contributions from newcomers as well as seasoned Runestone hackers. You don't need to be an expert to make a contribution here. When I started this project I had barely written a line of Javascript, Runestone is a project that is all about helping people learn, if you learn by helping us improve Runestone that is even better!

Your next moves should be to check out the `documentation <runestoneserver.readthedocs.org>`\_ It will guide you though installation and give you an overview of how Runestone is put together. The documentation is a work in progress so don't be shy about letting us know whats missing.
